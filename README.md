Human in the Loop AI for Recruiter Decision Support

This repository documents a product case study for an AI-assisted recruiter decision support platform. The system is designed to augment recruiter judgment, not automate hiring decisions, by providing structured, explainable AI evaluations while keeping final accountability with humans.

The project demonstrates end to end product thinking across problem framing, UX design, AI system architecture, metrics, and roadmap planning aligned with real world constraints.

### Problem Overview

Recruiters screening large volumes of candidates face:

- High cognitive load and decision fatigue

- Inconsistent resume evaluation

- Limited transparency from automated screening tools

- Risk of over-reliance on opaque AI systems

This project explores how AI can responsibly support recruiters by improving signal quality without removing human agency.

### Product Goals

- Reduce time spent per candidate screened

- Improve consistency and structure in evaluations

- Increase recruiter confidence in screening decisions

- Ensure transparency, explainability, and accountability in AI usage
